            <h3>Crazy Gamer | Lazy Programmer</h3>
            <p>You know that i want to be a programmer and the life of a programmer is quite dense – most programmers
                spend
                much of their time writing code using the computer language and thinking on how to solve problems such
                as
                testing and solving for bugs in the code or thinking of how to create a new feature. It doesn't mean at
                all
                that other jobs are serene.</p>
